# 🌐 MakerWorld Description Workflow

## 📌 What

How to manage MakerWorld model descriptions as git-tracked `DESCRIPTION.md` files and publish them to MakerWorld.

## 🤔 Why

- ✅ Keep MakerWorld descriptions versioned, reviewable, and easy to update alongside model changes
- 🖼️ Store images in the shared assets repo so source repos stay lean and links remain stable
- 🔁 Use one Markdown source that can be edited in Git and republished to MakerWorld as HTML

## 🔧 How

### Extract (MakerWorld → Git)

Use the `makerworld-description` skill to extract a description from a MakerWorld model page:

1. Provide the MakerWorld model URL
2. The skill scrapes the page, downloads images to the **assets repo**, and creates `DESCRIPTION.md`
3. Commit the `DESCRIPTION.md` to the source repo and images to `kellerlabs/assets`

### Publish (Git → MakerWorld)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cmd/export/md-to-mw.py models/<name>/makerworld/DESCRIPTION.md
```

This generates `DESCRIPTION.html` (gitignored). Open it in a browser, `Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C`, paste into MakerWorld's description editor.

### Edit

1. Edit `DESCRIPTION.md` directly in the source repo
2. Re-run `md-to-mw.py` to regenerate HTML
3. Re-paste into MakerWorld

### Update (After Model Changes)

Use the `makerworld-description` skill's **Update flow** to refresh a description after a release:

1. Invoke the skill with a request like "update core description with latest changes"
2. The skill reads `CHANGELOG.md`, filters model-relevant changes, and proposes edits
3. Review the proposed changelog entries and feature bullet updates
4. The skill checks the assets repo for new images and suggests placements
5. Frontmatter gets an `updated: YYYY-MM-DD` field
6. Publish with `md-to-mw.py` (see above)

## 📁 Image & Layout Formatting

> ⚠️ **Cross-repo workflow**: This skill requires both the source repo and [`kellerlabs/assets`](https://github.com/kellerlabs/assets). Maintainers push images directly to `assets/main`. Outside collaborators must open a PR on the assets repo for image changes.

Images are stored in **[kellerlabs/assets](https://github.com/kellerlabs/assets)**, not in the source repos.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kellerlabs/assets/main/<repo>/models/<name>/makerworld/images/<file>
```

- Use `<img>` tags with `width` (no `height`) so images scale proportionally
- Use `<h2 style="text-align: center">` and `<p style="text-align: center">` for centered elements
- These HTML blocks render correctly on GitHub and pass through to `md-to-mw.py`

`md-to-mw.py` passes absolute URLs through unchanged. Base64 embedding only applies to local relative paths.

### Create (New Description)

Create a new `DESCRIPTION.md` from scratch:

1. Gather the model details and verify images in the assets repository.
2. Create `DESCRIPTION.md` and enhance `CUSTOMIZATION.md` with the verified images.
3. Optionally publish with `md-to-mw.py` (see above).
